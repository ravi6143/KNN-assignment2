    "1. Dimensionality Reduction: Use dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n",

    "5. Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple KNN models through techniques like KNN bagging or KNN boosting to improve predictive performance and reduce overfitting.\n",
